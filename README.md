# Html2Markdown4KindleNotes
This simple script is for converting html to markdown. It is for Kindle notes.

For Windows platform, there are mainly 3 softwares, [clippings.io](https://www.clippings.io/), [Kindle Mate](http://kmate.me/cn/) and [Knotes](http://knotesapp.com/). Clippings.io and Knotes are commercial softwares. Kindle Mate is not. However, my reading pattern is highlight notes in Kindle and after the book is finished the notes are exported to external text file for me to do a post-reading summary. I do not need the abundant features in those softwares. Also i do not want to pay them.

Therefore, I use the official Kindle software on my Windows system to export all highlighted notes in a book to html file. This script is used to convert the ugly html to formated markdown file. Currently, it is just a list of notes. My final reading summary is in markdown. So it is convenient.
